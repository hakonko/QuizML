"A classification model is evaluated on 3 classes: A, B, and C. For each class, you are given the precision and recall values at each relevant threshold.The average precision (AP) is defined as the area under the precision-recall curve for each class.
Suppose we approximate this area using the 11-point interpolated Average Precision method, where precision is measured at 11 recall levels: {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0}. For each recall level r, the precision is defined as the maximum precision obtained for any recall ≥ r.
You are given the following interpolated precision values:
Class A: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5]
Class B: [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.6, 0.6, 0.5]
Class C: [0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65, 0.6, 0.6, 0.55, 0.5, 0.4]";mAP = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N AP_i,  \text{ where N is the number of classes};0.700;0.727;0.750;0.800;0.833;_alt3;4
